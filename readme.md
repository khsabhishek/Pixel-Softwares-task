This project is a Social Media application built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Users can create posts with text and images, and these posts are stored on the IPFS decentralized storage network. The application uses the Pinata SDK to pin the post images to IPFS, and the Ethereum smart contract to store post content and IPFS hash.
